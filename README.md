# ESP32 BLE Examples for Arduino

This repository contains example codes that can be used as templates for your BLE project with the ESP32 board. All these examples have been explained [this video](https://youtu.be/P0aqbD9umDE).

## Android Apps
For the client app on your smartphone, I recommend using the [nRF connect app](https://www.nordicsemi.com/?sc_itemid={41FF7A0B-B565-420A-95B7-B32122B5D3AD}).
The examples BLE_switch and BLE_everything_to_string look best on the custom app available [here](https://github.com/LiveSparks/BLE_Viewer_App).
